# Command-Line-Hacks
Quick and dirty command line implementations.

This is a collection of common Unix command line tools that I took a crack at writing imitations of as recommended
in Zed Shaw's book, "Learn More Python the Hard Way".

Each one took about an hour or so to write and I attempted to reference Zed's code as little as possible with the
exception of the uniq command. On that one I was pretty stuck trying to find a way to chain together multiple commands.
In the end, I moved on before fully getting the chaining to work the way I wanted, but each tool does its job to
a certain minimum level of functionality.
